Source/parser recovery hint:
- No eligible direct_aosp_camera candidate is available in this pool. Check collection failures, candidate dates and source-policy blockers before attributing the gap to a parser defect.
- No eligible Android candidate is available in this pool. Check collection results and selection exclusions; an empty bucket alone does not establish a parser defect.
